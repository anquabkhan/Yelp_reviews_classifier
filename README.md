# Natural language processing project to analyze and Yelp reviews data
Project Overview:
<ul>
<li> Achieved data analysis and data cleaning of the yelp reviews database containing the sevreal reviews and the ratings(stars) given to them by customer's </li>
  <li> Created a histogram for the length of the reviews </li>
  <li> Created a countplot to compare the number of stars given by the users </li>
    <li> Created a faceit grid for the stars colunm </li>
  <li> Created a function to remove the punctuation and stopwords from each review </li>
  <li> Used the Countvectorizer to transform the given reviews into vectors on the basis of frequency of words </li> 
<li> Used the naive bayes classifier to train the model on the training data and making predictions using the testing data </li>
<li> Evaluated the model using the confusion matrix, classification report and the seaborn heatmap </li>
  <li> Added the TF-IDF feature to further improve the models performance </li>
</ul>

# Code and resources used:
<ul>
  <li>Python version- 3.9</li>
  <li>Packages- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn, string, nltk</li>
  <li> Tools and algorithms- Google colab, stopwords, train_test_split, CountVectorizer, Naive_bayes, MultinomialNB, confusion_matrix, classification_report, TfidfTransformer </li> 
</ul>
